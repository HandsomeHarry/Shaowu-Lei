# Shaowu Lei

> Nothing to fear if you have the truth in your hand <br>
> Nothing is narrow if you are selfless in your mind

The greatest and all-powerful scientist around the world.



## Lei's Mathematics 

- Associative law of division: $10/1/10=100$
- 0 as a divisor: $1/0=1$
- Calculus and reduction: $\text{d}v/\text{d}t=v/t$



## Lei's Mechanics

- Newton's classical mechanics is totally wrong.

  > Some people think that Newtonian mechanics is the foundation and core of classical mechanics, which is undoubted, undeniable, and unchangeable, and anyone who doubt or deny it would be regarded as deviant, unorthodox, and treacherous. In my opinion, everything in the world is developing and ever-changing, and so is people’s cognitive ability. Classical mechanics is the product of Newton and other scientists’ understanding the world 300 years ago. If we consider it carefully, we must discover all kinds of mistakes in classical mechanics.

  > *--- Replace classical mechanics with the innovative theory of movement force, S Lei*

- Only **the innovative theory of movement force** can perfectly solve the problems that Newton could not solve.

  **Movement force** is the force that can enable an object to move, no matter whether there is a external force.

  Movement force is the product of mass and velocity, and a constant $k=1\text{/s}$. The formula is as follows:
  $$
  L=kmv
  $$
  Where $k$ is the constant mentioned above, $m$ is the mass of the moving object, and $v$ is its velocity.

- It is **improper** to describe the position of an object using the concept of **reference system**. Anything's location is, and can only be described as, **"its unique location"**.



## Lei's Electromagnetism



## Lei's Thermology



## Lei's Chemistry



## Lei's Biology



## Lei's Language

- Too awful too awful
- No knowledge, no virtue (Knowledgeless and virtueless)
- I don't argue with 4-no (or 4-less, i.e., knowledgeless, virtueless, shameless, and logicless) people.
- Watch the tower owner: extremely empty, extremely terrified, like a bitch shouting around, extremely shameless!
- Cannot see it clearly. If there is a movement, calculate it with $L=kmv$.
- Your expression is unclear. Go and do experiments, and tell us the results.
